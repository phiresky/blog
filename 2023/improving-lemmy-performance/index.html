Since in its core AP is really simple here’s a visual of how federation works:</p><p><img src="./activitypub-simple.drawio.svg" title=""/><br/></p><h2 id="fetching-redundant-data">Fetching redundant data</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3482">first large issue</a> I identified was a single query: <code class="not-highlighted">CommunityFollowerView::for_community</code>.</p><p>Whenever a user does a action on Lemmy (post a post, comment, like / dislike something), that action has to be federated to all interested users on other instances.</p><p>This worked as follows:</p><ol start="1" type="1"><li>Retrieve a list of all users following the community from the database</li><li>Filter the follows to only the non-local followers</li><li>Get the inboxes of all the followers. If the instance of the follower has a shared (domain-wide) inbox, use that.</li><li>Send the activity to all the collected inboxes</li></ol><p>Seems reasonable, right? Well, turns out this query was causing 2Gbit/s of data transfer out of the database, fetching 4 billion rows and causing 8 days of database query time per day. Why? There’s two reasons</p><ol start="1" type="1"><li><p>Lemmy uses the <a href="https://diesel.rs/">Diesel ORM</a>. Diesel allows fetching any subset of columns, but like any ORM it encourages abstracting tables into full structs and only ever fetching and updating all columns for simplicity.</p><p>In this case, the query fetched this combined struct:</p><pre class="rust" style="color:#ccc;background:#2d2d2d;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;font-size:1em;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:.5em 0;overflow:auto"><code class="language-rust" style="white-space:pre;color:#ccc;background:none;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;font-size:1em;text-align:left;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none"><span class="token token" style="color:#cc99cd">pub</span><span> </span><span class="token token" style="color:#cc99cd">struct</span><span> </span><span class="token token type-definition" style="color:#f8c555">CommunityFollowerView</span><span> </span><span class="token token" style="color:#ccc">{</span><span>

</span><span></span><span class="token token" style="color:#ccc">}</span></code></pre><p>The community and person structs both have over 20 columns. So for a like of a comment in a community with 20k followers, it was reading 20k copies of stuff like the full private and public key of the community, in addition to every user’s name, key, and biography.</p><p>So we only need around ~15 <button class="footnote-button">note</button> bytes per follower (the inbox URL), it was reading around 2kB <button class="footnote-button">note</button>. That’s an overhead of &gt;99%.</p></li><li><p>Most federated instances support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#shared-inbox-delivery">shared inboxes</a>, which means that if the 20k followers are spread out over 1000 instances, we really only have a bit over 1000 URLs. This is a bit harder to optimize for since we have no guarantees this is the case, but just doing the uniqueness reduction in the database instead of in Rust is already a great improvement.</p></li></ol><p>Simplified, I changed out this query:</p><pre class="sql" style="color:#ccc;background:#2d2d2d;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;font-size:1em;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:.5em 0;overflow:auto"><code class="language-sql" style="white-space:pre;color:#ccc;background:none;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;font-size:1em;text-align:left;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none"><span class="token token" style="color:#cc99cd">select</span><span> </span><span class="token token" style="color:#67cdcc">*</span><span> </span><span class="token token" style="color:#cc99cd">from</span><span> community

The new query isn’t really much cheaper than the previous one (it scans the same amount of rows with a similar query plan), but it stores and transfers much less data. This could be further optimized by joining instances instead of persons, but that would need special cases for federated software that doesn’t support shared inbox.</p><div class="info-box"><p>Tip: Sometimes it’s not just about the amount of rows the database has to scan, but also the amount of data transferred between your application and the database</p></div><figure><img src="./netdata-after-pr.png" title=""/><figcaption>Can you tell when the the fix was applied?</figcaption></figure><h2 id="missing-indexes">Missing indexes</h2><p>Something more boring that is very common in SQL databases are missing indexes. Lemmy didn’t have many of these but still a few: <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3483" class="auto-linked">https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3483</a> . These are also really easy to not notice because it doesn’t matter as long as your tables are small.</p><div class="info-box"><p>Tip: To find them during development try doing <code class="not-highlighted">set enable_seqscan=off</code> (to forbid slow table scans) and also looking at the <code class="not-highlighted">explain analyze</code>. Ideally your query will only have <code class="not-highlighted">Index (Only) Scans</code>. Watch out for <code class="not-highlighted">Bitmap Index/Heap Scan</code>s or <code class="not-highlighted">Index Scan</code>s with high <span class="quoted">&quot;<!-- -->Removed by filter<!-- -->&quot;</span> counts since those are also costly and can often be improved.
