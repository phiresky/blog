For example, a "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"text"]},{"t":"Str","c":" column is very often actually more like a mix of "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"enum"]},{"t":"Str","c":" and free form text, with a few very common values. An "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"integer"]},{"t":"Str","c":" or "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"enum"]},{"t":"Str","c":" is often "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"0"]},{"t":"Str","c":", "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"1"]},{"t":"Str","c":" or "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"first_enum_value"]},{"t":"Str","c":". Ofetn there’s columns that are "},{"t":"Code","c":[["",[],[]],"null"]},{"t":"Str","c":" 100% of the time."}]},{"t":"Para","c":[{"t":"Str","c":"If you just sample randomly, you won’t get the same query plans as on production.

Depending on how strict your application is, it might crash when seeing the mock data.
