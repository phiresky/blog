Unfortunately, this only applies if the increase in speed depends linearly on the zoom level…. but this is not the case with normal zooming… there it is rather quadratic… so every zoom level further up makes you move twice as fast to the right left… but this somehow results in a strange non-linear space with strange properties and I haven’t managed to define a distance metric in there, let alone the shortest path between two points"}]]}]},{"t":"Para","c":[{"t":"Str","c":"– my friend rambling about calculating flight paths"}]}]},{"t":"Figure","c":[["",[],[]],[null,[{"t":"Plain","c":[{"t":"Str","c":"Blub-space transformation for smooth flight paths.
