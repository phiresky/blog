The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \\"dropout\\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021","4","18"]]},"author":[{"family":"Krizhevsky","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Sutskever","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Hinton","given":"Geoffrey E."}],"container-title":"Communications of the ACM","id":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3098997.3065386","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017","5"]]},"page":"84-90","title":"ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"60"},{"URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556","abstract":"In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting.

By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\xd7 deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021","4","18"]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"K."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"X."},{"family":"Ren","given":"S."},{"family":"Sun","given":"J."}],"container-title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","id":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780459","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"keyword":"Training, Degradation, Complexity theory, Image recognition, Neural networks, Visualization, Image segmentation","note":"ISSN: 1063-6919","page":"770-778","title":"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition","type":"paper-conference"}],"title":"Automatic citation extraction from URLs","url2cite":"all-links","url2cite-cache":"./pandoc-url2cite-cache.json","url2cite-link-output":"sup","urlcolor":"blue"},"preview":"pandoc-url2cite[1] allows you to instantly and transparently cite most papers directly given only a single URL.
